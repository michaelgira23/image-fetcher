# reddit-image-fetcher
A simple little script that returns a random image from any given subreddit.

## Setup
Runing it is easy peasy, just run `npm update` to install all the necessary dependencies. The main script is found under `index.js` and the default port is `1500`.

## Configuring
Everything can be found in the `index.js` file. You can add multiple subreddits if you want in the config JSON at the top of the file, as well as change the port.
